### Following Design System
 we use the idea of [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) as a part of building a web page.

 Basic Terminology
* Atom - A single and the most basic entity in our system. This can be anything, be it a single image or a simple piece of text indicating a headline/subheadline.

* Molecules - Group of atoms forms a molecule. A combination of an image and a headline can form a card, which is indeed a molecu****le.
`Atom + Atom = Molecule`

* Row - Group of molecules forms a row. A couple of card groups arranged in some order can form a row. This can be the highest entity level in our system where multiple rows form a web page.
`Molecule + Molecule = Row`.
